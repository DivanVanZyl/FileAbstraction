Reading
Search dirs for file when no path is given. But only search user folder, and start with current dir.
It will take too long to search all the system dirs, and the file is probably not there.

Writing
Add other types of file operations, eg bin files
Possibly disaplay warning if disk space is low.

General
Refactor to infer file type: txt, binary etc.
Move type validations to constructors in new classes to represent those types: FileName, FilePath
